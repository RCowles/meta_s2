Meta_s2
===

Meta_s2 (Metascores 2) is a WordPress theme that I originally hacked together to test out [Jetpack's Featured Content](http://jetpack.me/support/featured-content/). Since then, I have added some basic layout and styling, converted the CSS to SASS, and turned the theme into a mess.

I'm not sure what my endgame is, but as of now I plan on continuing to build this theme out to a.) learn and b.) possibly make something presentable.

Additional Info
---------------

* As the name may suggest, this theme is built using [_s](https://github.com/Automattic/_s). You can head over to http://underscores.me and generate your own `_s` based theme there. 
* Parts of the theme may require having [Jetpack](http://jetpack.me/) installed and connected to function properly.
* You _might_ be able to see a live preview of the theme itself at [ryancowles.me](http://ryancowles.me/)... but no guarantees.
* Pull request are more than welcome!
